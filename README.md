For the first part of the homework we create a data frame to easily analyze the data. We create the dataframe so we can graph 
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The scatter plots will show us the relationships between Latitude and the different weather features like temperature. 

latitude and Cloudiness seems to have no relationship whatsoever, and wind speed always doesnt seem to depend on latitude

We then cut the latitude into North/South parts then use scatterplots and linear regression to mathematically deduce relationships. The higher the vlaue of r sqaured the better.

North vs Max temperature had the highest r value, while south vs cloudiness had the smallest r values.
